# TYPOGRAPHY FUNCTION 1.0 – BY KVC
The **Typography function** will become the main tool for the **batch programmers** for editing **amazing text** (not simple ones). And, effects on the console, as it prints a text string on the console in a very unique way. So, how is it different from the **Echo command**? Let us show you an example of it, with a picture. Which will clarify 90% of your doubts, The rest of the 10% we will clarify. That’s why we are here.

So, now we think that you can simply differentiate between the two text strings “Hello World” Written above on the console screen. The lower one (small size) is written by using the in-built function ‘Echo’. And, the upper one (Bigger size) is written by using ‘The Typography function’.

# 3D TEXT EFFECT IN BATCH – TYPOGRAPHY FUNCTION
We’ve analyzed many of the older batch programs, which use lengthy and time-consuming scripting for just showing a **simple text effect** on the console. But now, you can show these texts simply on the cmd console with the help of this function. You can print **3D looking texts**… let me show you the start screen of my current project and you’ll get an idea about the function.

Some of the **hacker movies** and mainly **Ironman** inspired me to write a code – which will make it easy to do typography on the console. Now without any delay, let’s talk about the technical part of – **How to use Typography Function?**

## AND, I AM IRONMAN…]

As in the above image, you can see the code line written above the **‘Welcome Mr. Stark’**. You have to simply call the **‘Typo function’** and the following image will show you the help menu of this function. As you noted above, one line of batch code results in reducing too much of code and headache. Imagine doing all of that with raw Batch code, You’ll be scratching your heads for hours!

While using this function in your **batch file**, if you need to call the typo function more than 2 or 3 times, then the speed of function may be an important factor. As during multiple calls, its speed gets reduced. Because each time you will call **Typo function**, it will load the **FONT file** each time. So, to get rid of this time problem and for making it more efficient. We’ve introduced another sub-function named **‘Load.bat’**.

Now, what you have to do is, call the **Load function** once. And now the font file is **permanently loaded** into the cmd environment (until you load another Font file). Now you can Call the **Typo Function** multiple times – while consuming the minimum possible time.

# SYNTAX TO USE THIS FUNCTION
Here, It is the simple general syntax, which is usable in the case where you need to call it once or twice in your Batch Program. Because calling once or twice will take a very little amount of execution time.

```
Call Typo Pixcel.FO 5 5 aa Testing Function
```
Here, it is the **special syntax** which is usable in case of multiple calls from your **batch program**. Note that, you must call the **‘ASCII.DB’** file along with the FONT file (The above syntax will be slightly modified as below).

```
Call Load ASCII.DB Pixcel.FO
Call Typo - 5 5 aa Testing Function
```
